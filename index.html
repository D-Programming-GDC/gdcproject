<h3>What is GDC?</h3>

<p>GDC is a GPL implementation of the D compiler which integrates the open
source D front end with GCC.

<p>The GNU D Compiler (GDC) project was originally started by David
Friedman in 2004 until early 2007 when he disappeared from the D scene, and
was no longer able to maintain GDC.  Following a revival attempt in 2008, GDC
is now under the lead of Iain Buclaw who has been steering the project since
2009 with the assistance of its contributors, without them the project would
not have been nearly as successful as it has been.

<h3>Bugs in GDC</h3>

<p>Please report bugs!

<p>Any bugs or issues found with using GDC should be reported at
<a href="http://bugzilla.gdcproject.org">our bugzilla site</a>.
Bug reports can be anything from problems, enhancements, incorrect or incomplete
documentation, web changes, or even WIP projects.

<p>Please note that if you find bugs in GDC that you installed with a given
GNU/Linux distribution, it is often useful to first try reporting the bug
directly to the distributor.  Sometimes distributors have
modified the software (as they are free to do so!) or they are running
older versions.  Thus, they may be the best people to find a bug as it
pertains to a particular distribution.

<p>Before submitting a new bug, try
<a href="http://bugzilla.gdcproject.org/describecomponents.cgi">browsing</a>
the current open bugs to see if the problem has already been reported or
even fixed.

<p>It is also very helpful if you can try reproducing the problem with a
current GDC snapshot available from git.  Often bugs in a release branch
have already been fixed in the latest development sources.

<p>While bug reports may seem like individual assistance, they are not;
they are part of preparing a new improved version.  For general help with
GDC, the <a href="http://forum.dlang.org/group/D.gnu">D.gnu</a> mailing list
is the place to go with questions or problems.
