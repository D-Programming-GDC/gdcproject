### What is GDC? ###

GDC is a GPL implementation of the D compiler which integrates the open
source D front end with GCC.

The GNU D Compiler (GDC) project was originally started by David Friedman
in 2004 until early 2007 when he disappeared from the D scene, and was no
longer able to maintain GDC.  Following a revival attempt in 2008, GDC is
now under the lead of Iain Buclaw, who has been steering the project since
2009 with the assistance of its contributors. Without them, the project
would not have been nearly as successful as it has been.

### Bugs in GDC ###

Please report bugs!

Any bugs or issues found with using GDC should be reported at [our bugzilla
site][bugzilla].  Bug reports can be anything from problems, enhancements,
incorrect or incomplete documentation, web changes, or even WIP projects.

Please note that if you find bugs in GDC that you installed with a given
GNU/Linux distribution, it is often useful to first try reporting the bug
directly to the distributor.  Sometimes distributors have modified the
software (as they are free to do so!) or they are running older versions.
Thus, they may be the best people to find a bug as it pertains to a
particular distribution.

Before submitting a new bug, try [browsing][openbugs] the current open
bugs to see if the problem has already been reported or even fixed.

It is also very helpful if you can try reproducing the problem with a
current GDC snapshot available from git.  Often bugs in a release branch
have already been fixed in the latest development sources.

While bug reports may seem like individual assistance, they are not; they
are part of preparing a new improved version.  For general help with GDC,
the [D.gnu][mailinglist] mailing list is the place to go with questions
or problems.
