### Contributing to GDC ###

GDC is currently developed by a very small group.  While the addition of a
D front-end to GCC represents a great step forward for D, it also
represents an informal promise by the D community to keep the D frontend
up to date with the latest GCC development.

Thanks to Github and Git, contributing to GDC is as easy as forking the
repository and submitting a pull request (although this workflow will
likely change when the merge is officially complete), and filing a bug
report is a simple web form.

If you use GDC, we encourage you to try to contribute, whether by
submitting bugfixes, new features, documentation updates, web page
improvements, etc.  In the past, GDC has nearly died due to poor
communication and lack of development.  Avoiding those issues is easier
than ever before, but GDC will always need a community that's willing to
give back.

For access to the current development sources of GDC, visit [our git
repository][git].  Documentation on GDC is available from [the wiki][wiki].

If you are looking for a project to help improve GDC, check the [project
ideas][ideas] page.

Work is currently under way to merge GDC into a future release of GCC.
Any assitance of any sort during this time would be invaluably appreciated.
